# Love Running website

The Love Running website is an imagined website provided for a local running community. The site contains basic information for runners who may wish to drop in for a run or a social meetup at specific times and locations. The site also provides links to any additional social media presence the running group might have.

## Features 

The site consists of three pages; Home, Gallery and Signup. While the Home page contains the highest priority information such as the meetup times and motivational messages, the Gallery page reinforces the sense of community and inclusion by displaying images of the runners on a virtual photo wall. For consistency of user experience, the site's logo, navigation links and social media links on the page footer are repeated across the site pages.

The Love Running website is a responsive website. That means that the site will maintain its integrity of design and layout when viewed on desktop, tablet or mobile devices. The site elements will rearrange themselves according to the current browser screen width and the finished site will allow for three different screen widths to maintain the consistency of design and information presentation.
